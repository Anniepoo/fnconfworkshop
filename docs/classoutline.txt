# Prolog all day workshop

Positioning -
Use the paper from online class

Nature of queries (hand puppets)
 * conversational
 * constructive proof
 * n solutions
 * cut
 * open/closed worlds

Prolog is a query language - paradigm
  - Do family tree.

Demo adultschildren.pl - everybody step through

Syntactic elements

operators

facts, rules, directives. Define them, don't go off on them.

unification  (hand puppets)
1=1
1=2
X=1
1=1,a=a.
X=Y.  (new X)
X=Y,Y=3,3=X.

SLD resolution - 
start with a goal
unify- resolve loop
unify - argument binding
    multimodality comes here (save append for later)
    no arg eval
    choice points

failure

backtracking.

Prolog provides proofs - this is how we got into the brothers problem.

recursion has tail call optimization

Cuts - (hand puppets)

Working with lists
[X,Y,3 |Z] = [1,2,3,a,b]
member
append (now demo why multimodal is cool)
length
nth0

Transpose exercise -
Work in groups
